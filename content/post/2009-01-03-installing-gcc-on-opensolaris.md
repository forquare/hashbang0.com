Ok, I know I've blogged this before, but this is about doing it via the command line:

I installed everything as root...
# pkg install SUNWgcc

Simple as that!

Some other packages people might like:
# pkg install SUNWgmake
# pkg install SUNWsvn

These have all come in handy whilst setting up my new server.
