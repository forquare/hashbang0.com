If you navigate your browser to [here][1], you will find a most amazing thing: Tetris crafted out of a SED script with a bash wrapper.Â  The page is in Russian, but Google or another translation site will tell you that the first few words read:
> Wrote a small Tetris on sed's: sedtris.sed and wrapper on Bashe sedtris.sh
Download both scripts to the same directory, on the command line do:

`bash sedtris.sh`

It's actually very good!
