The [Intel Manager game is on it's third incarnation][1] and brings a very different form of game play.
I didn't play the IMG2, but in the first version you bought more servers and upgraded network cards etc (choices from 'no-name' brands up to Intel's finest).  This new version you do no buying.  You first train in various areas by completing challenges (answering an Intel related question) or taking the training course (your skill is increased over a short period of time).  Once you have learnt a skill (such as multi-core) you can apply it to the employees desktop/laptop.

I think I prefer the first version, I wish they had built apon that...
