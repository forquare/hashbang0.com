A couple of friends have made some apps for the iPhone/iPod Touch, so I thought I'd quickly plug them :P 
 
[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wager.png" width="199" height="199" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1238" title="wager" />][1]First up is [Wager by Tom Diggle][2].  This app is handy for calculating the return and profit of many betting types. 
 
It sports a succinct UI which is both fast and effective and allows for multiple bets to be stored for later reference. 
 
Find it on the [App Store for just 69p][3]!

Dive your sub to the depths of the ocean, is there ever an end!?  If there is, I've not found it yet! 
 
Once again, this can be found on the [App Store for just 69p!][6]
