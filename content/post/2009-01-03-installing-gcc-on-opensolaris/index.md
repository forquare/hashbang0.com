OK, I know I've blogged this before, but this is about doing it via the command line:
<!--more-->
I installed everything as root...
```
# pkg install SUNWgcc
```
Simple as that!

Some other packages people might like:
```
# pkg install SUNWgmake
# pkg install SUNWsvn
```

These have all come in handy whilst setting up my new server.
