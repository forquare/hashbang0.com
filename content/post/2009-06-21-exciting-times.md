Well, I'm setting into my new hosting well, I've been playing with the Wordpress plugins over the last few days and I'm pretty happy with the results.

I've installed Akismet, the SPAM filter for posts, stats, 'share this' tiles (at the bottom of the post) and I've hooked it up to twitter! Who'd have thought it!? [Follow me now][1] for updates on when I post! Also, browse here on your iPhone or other mobile device, and get my blog served to you in a friendly, mobile format!

I'm still fiddling, if I break stuff, I'm sorry, just giggle to yourself when things go wrong :D
