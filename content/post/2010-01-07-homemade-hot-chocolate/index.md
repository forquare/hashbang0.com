I know, I know, making hot chocolate isn't geeky, but I've been wanting to try it for ages.  I bought some 200g [Bournville ][1]bars to try out a recipe.  I basically made the recipe up, though looking at the internet now, it seems that it's similar to others.

Ingredients include:
8 blocks of Bournville chocolate
1 teaspoon of sugar
Mug of milk (I used semi-skimmed)
Pinch of allspice

I measured a mug of milk (as much as I wanted), and transferred the milk into a saucepan.  Putting the hob on high I popped on the saucepan.  While stirring with a whisk I added a few pinches of allspice (as I didn't have cinnamon or mixed spice) and a teaspoon of sugar.
When the milk started to steam I added four blocks of chocolates (I broke them up before adding them) and started to stir vigorously with the whisk, when they had melted I added another four block of chocolate.  Having done it, I think next time I might grate the eight blocks to save a little time.
When the chocolate had melted I continued to whisk until the milk was bubbly then poured into my mug again.  If I had had it, a squiring of cream would have been a very nice addition!
