Well, the news hit the two company sites at around 12:30 BST by my reckoning.  [Sun.com][1] and [Oracle.com][2] both reveled the news at around the same time ([sun clicky][3] and [oracle clicky][4] &lt;- pics of the sites on the day).

I think this is a much better acquisition than what IBM offered, personally, I think IBM were looking to buy up competition, Oracle have a number of reasons to buy Sun as I see it:

* Expanding the business into new markets means more fingers in more pies, hopefully those pies have got meat in them otherwise you've wasted your time.
* [Fishworks][5], the ability to create appliances.
* A large base of customers running Oracle on Solaris and Sun kit.
* Solaris technologies such as ZFS and DTrace
The Oracle site has an amount of information for existing customers etc. It can be found [here][6].
There is a discussion over at opensolaris.org which echo's some of my thoughts, found [here][7].

We'll have to wait and see what happens, but it's going to be an odd couple of months these last two working for Sun/Oracle.  I'm glad this has happened while I was on an industrial year, I've gained the experience of a potential take-over and that of a take-over with little risks attached for me, far more than I can say if it happens in a couple of years time when I potentially have mouths to feed and a mortgage to pay!

My weekly blog will continue, due Friday, I will expand on the other events of today and probably link to this article...
