Well it's been a long time since I've been here.  After a quick update it all looks very shiny again.  What happened to 2013!?  Mostly full of work, friends, and reading in the ruins of Aberystwyth castle. 
 
Since the last post in 2012, I have moved from Aberystwyth to Frome in Somerset.  I no longer work with ERTMS, or indeed on the railway at all, for the last month and a half I have been an employee at [Ntegra][1] where I have been working with one of their clients to configure many virtual machines running Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
 
All of the ERTMS stuff seemed quite secret, and so bespoke at the moment that few people would find the ins and outs interesting.  Now I'm back working with computers, I hope to post here more - mainly with things I've learnt so I have an easy place to come back to, but hopefully others will find such information useful.
