I've just ordered three Western Digital 2TB drives, my plan is to use ZFS's RAID-Z to glue them together, I figure I'll get around 4TB worth of space doing this.  Currently I have mirrored storage which is good, but I'm effectively wasting 1TB of my current 2TB.

The disks will be arriving on Saturday, I'm working Saturday evening so I'll either install them Sunday or sometime next week.  I'll post back here to post my method of RAIDing them...
