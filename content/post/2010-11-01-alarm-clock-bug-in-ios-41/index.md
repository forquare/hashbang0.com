This week I am working the early shift at work.  I must be in [Machynlleth][1] by 5am meaning that I've got to get up at 3:30am and leave by 4:30am.  However, today when my 3:30 alarm went off, it was actually 4:30...

This bug has already been seen in Australia and revolves around moving out of, or into, Summer Time.  Strangely, one off alarms seem to be OK, it's those recurring alarms - you know, the ones you might set to repeat every weekday to get you up for work - that will trigger this bug.

Here's some screen shots, I set this alarm at about 4:50 this morning and wanted it to go off every weekday at 5am, needless to say it went off at 6am:

So, tomorrow my alarm will be set for 2:30am, and will be set for an hour early until an update appears!
