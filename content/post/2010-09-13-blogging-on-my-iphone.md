Last Friday I recieved my iPhone 4. I have to say I'm impressed with the speed of the thing, much more responsive than my old first generation iPod touch.

I'm loving the freedom of mobile Internet too, though I've not had a huge Chavez chance to make the most of it here in mid-Wales...

With this new phone also come iOS 4 which I couldn't get on my iPod touch, mult-tasking isn't something I've needed to do just yet, but I'm sure I'll appreciate it at some point.

Apart from mobile Internet, multi-tasking, and better response, it's all fairly similar to my old iPod.

Blogged from my new iPhone ;)
