Sherlock is one of my all time favourites.  No, not the stories, the game!

Written by [Everett Kaser][2] many moons ago, I first played this classic game on DOS and taught how to play it by my Dad.  At the time it felt fairly hard, and it still catches me out from time to time now! 
 
This is my current "I've got five minutes to fill", or indeed "I've got half an hour to fill" game.  I play it on the way home from work, knowing I'll get about six games out of it. 
 
It's not visually stunning, but the graphics do give that nostalgic feeling of being back in DOS, it even has some DOS style animations and sounds!

The game can be a bit fiddly, having been originally designed to tap squares with a mouse, but once you've got the hang of it it's fairly easy to do by finger. 
 
I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a quick logic puzzle.  Especially as it's on the [App Store for FREE!][4]
