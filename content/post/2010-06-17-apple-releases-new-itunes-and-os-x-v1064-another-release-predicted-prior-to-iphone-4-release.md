Yesterday Apple released [iTunes 9.2][1] touting the following enhancements:

* Sync with iPhone 4 to enjoy your favourite music, movies, TV shows, books and more on-the-go
* Sync and read books with iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 4 and iBooks 1.1
* Organise and sync PDF documents as books. Read PDFs with iBooks 1.1 on iPad and any iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 4
* Organise your apps on your iOS 4 home screens into folders using iTunes
* Faster back-ups while syncing an iPhone or iPod touch with iOS 4
* Album artwork improvements make artwork appear more quickly when exploring your library
I got excited about the first point there, not because I've ordered an iPhone, but because if my Mac can sync with one, I should have the iPhone 4 icon.Â  However, I don't...

Looking in _/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources_ reveals the old iPhone icons and plenty of Mac and iPod Touch/iPad icons, but no iPhone 4 icon.

I think this means Apple will be releasing either a 'point' update for iTunes (perhaps 9.2.1) or another small update somewhere else along the way.
