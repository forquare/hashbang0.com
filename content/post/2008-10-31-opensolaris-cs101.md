On Thursday 30th October, I attended the CS101 lecture in Aber uni.  I was there to give a brief talk about OpenSolaris, focusing on aspects like Zones, DTrace and ZFS.  I think it went OK, possibly pitched it a tad too high, and I missed out tonnes of stuff I wanted to put in, like the copy on write feature of ZFS...

If anyone attended that lecture and is reading this, please feel free email me any questions you might have about OpenSolaris.  If I can't answer them, I can find an answer :)
