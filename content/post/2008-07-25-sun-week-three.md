This last week I have been on yet another training course! This week is was to look at the SunFire mid-range servers, a.k.a. The Serengeti range
The serengetis are the [3800][1], [4800][2] and the [6800,][3] with a couple or variations.

We looked at how to administer them and service them basically.
