Anyway, I've been using Google Reader for the past year or so with some satisfaction, but then my browser crashed and for some reason, all of my feeds are telling me I've read everything... 
 
Anyhoo, I've found an answer, and I think it's rather good.  It's called [Gruml][2].  It basically replicates Google Reader functionality using a local app.  It's in beta at the moment and it does feel quite "beta-ish", but I'm hoping for a Mail type solution where I can view my old feeds and entries offline if I want to. 
 
Gruml has some nice features that should be really good when it matures: 

* Tweeting articles
* Post articles to Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Bebo and more
* With the help of another blogging app (like MarsEdit) post articles to your blog
* Post notes
* Organise articles into folders
