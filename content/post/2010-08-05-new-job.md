After a while of searching, I've finally found a job!

I now work for a company called [Eldin][1] in the Welsh town of [Machynlleth][2].
My job is to switch on and off the new [ERTMS][3] system that is being installed on the [Cambrian line][4].

After a few days on the job I can say that I'm really enjoying it and I hope that when my contract ends in December I'll get to stay on for some more!
