Once upon a time I had the notion that I would post something vaguely interesting or helpful once a month.  While working at Sun that was easy (also making myself blog about my weekly activities for later reference helped), even my final year of uni I pretty much managed it, but I now look back over the last few months and see that I've not posted anything really since early December, and before that sometime in October.   
 
I am still alive!  Still working on the ERTMS project in Machynlleth which is going well and with each new software update the system is getting more and more stable. 
 
Outside of work I am working on some bits in the virtual world of [Second Life][1], a good friend of mine creates objects and I have started writing scripts in the [Linden Scripting Language][2] to make his objects more interesting/interactive. 
 
OH!  I've got a new iMac!  A sexy 27" beast, equipped with a 3.4GHz Intel i7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon HD 6970M (2GB).  It replaces my three year old Mac Pro which I wasn't using to its full potential - so if anyone wants a 2009 Mac Pro (2x Intel Xeon 5500, 6GB RAM) let me know! 
 
Right, now I've got to work on something interesting for me next post!
