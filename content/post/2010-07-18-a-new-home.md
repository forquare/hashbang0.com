I've moved the blog again!

I got fed up with it being under hasnbang0.com/blog, I decided to move it to it's own subdomain.  The reason it was bugging me was that it was mixed in with all of my other files.  I needed to make scripts test to make sure it didn't touch the blog files, and that was a nuisance (simple, but a nuisance).

So, here we are: [blog.hashbang0.com][1]

Please update any links, and your RSS/Atom feeds, here are the updated feed links:

* [RSS 2.0][2]
* [RSS .92][3]
* [Atom 0.3][4]
I've no plans to move from now on, and I'm going to do a bit of trickery to make hashbang0.com/blog still work for anyone who really doesn't want to update their links.
