Last Saturday I called Tesco to try and order a 16GB iPhone 4 but they were out of stock :(

Yesterday they rang me back saying they had some in stock, I leaped at the chance of getting one and ordered it straight away.
As mentioned above, I've gone for the 16GB version - My first generation iPod Touch in 16GB and I'm not using all of that space yet...

I paid £230 for it which I think is an excellent price considering I paid £200 for my second hand iPod Touch!
