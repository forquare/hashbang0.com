I was just browsing through the `/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources` folder on my MacBook, just to see what was there, and I suddenly spied the iPad icon:

I'm not sure what update brought this, over the past few weeks we've had the 10.6.3 update, though I suspect it was the recent iTunes 9.1 update, I'll check with my Mac Pro back in Aber, I haven't updated the iTunes on that in a couple of weeks...
