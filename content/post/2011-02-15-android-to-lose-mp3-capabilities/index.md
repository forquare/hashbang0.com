Google has [chopped the H.264 codec out of it's Chrome browser][1] and replaced it with it's own, open source, WebM codec - All in the name of openness...
<!--more-->
While one can't deny that this is a good thing in terms of openness, Chrome still supports Adobe Flash, and many websites offer H.264 encoded media over WebM encoded media.  Microsoft IE and Apple Safari don't support WebM, while Mozilla Firefox and Opera support both H.264 and WebM.

It got me wondering, will Google strip out MP3 support from Android devices?  MP3 is also encumbered with patents and requires licensing (thought that could change in the future).  Will Google persuade users to re-encode their music libraries into [Vorbis][2]?  Or perhaps into WebM?
