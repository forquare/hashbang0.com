When did these start cropping up?  Noticed them yesterday, seems that someone signs a person/thing up to Facebook and you can all become a Fan.  Quite a good idea, similar to appreciation societies I guess...

So far I've become a Fan of Bill Bailey and Aber uni...Why?  Because they both rock and both contain beardy people...Who are, of course, the best kinda people around :P
