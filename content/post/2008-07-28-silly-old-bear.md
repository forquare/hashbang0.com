It's been really hot here the last couple of days, and it has finally decided to rain! Hopefully we'll see a slight drop in the humidity...

Anyhoo, it's not pouring, per say, but I was reminded of our dear old friends Winnie the Pooh and Christopher Robin from the Hundred Acres Wood...."_Tut tut, it looks like rain_"
> **"**_The rain, rain, rain came down, down, down
In rushing, rising riv'lets,
'til the river crept out of it's bed
And crept right into Piglet's!
Poor Piglet, he was frightened,
With quite a rightful fright.
And so, in desperation
A message he did write.
He placed it in a bottle
And it floated out of sight._

_And the rain, rain, rain came down, down, down
So Piglet started bailing.
He was unaware, atop his chair,
While bailing he was sailing!_

_And the rain, rain, rain came down, down, down
And the flood rose up, up, upper.
Pooh, too, was caught and so he thought,
"I must rescue my supper!"
Ten honey pots he rescued,
Enough to see him through,
But as he sopped up his supper,
The river sopped up Pooh!
And the water twirled and tossed him
In a honey pot canoe!_ **"**
Anyhoo, it seems to be getting a little stronger now...Night.
