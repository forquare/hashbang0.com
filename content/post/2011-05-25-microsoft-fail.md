The other week I was looking at how Windows generates the old 8.3 style names from a long name.  I came across [this article][1] on the Microsoft site, and noted the banner at the top:




[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/MS-Doh2.png" width="466" height="281" alt="This article applies to a different operating system than the one you are using. Article content that may not be relevant to you is disabled." class="size-full wp-image-1184 aligncenter" title="MS D&#39;oh!" />][2]




On the one hand, I like how they've picked up that I'm not using a specific version of Windows.  On the other hand I can still see the whole document where none of it is relevant, sp they haven't disabled anything...
