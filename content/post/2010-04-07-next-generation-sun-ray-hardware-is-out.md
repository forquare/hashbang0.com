Oracle have uncovered a new Sun Ray (ultra) thin client recently.  They seem to have been quite quiet as I haven't heard any news about it.

The client is called the Oracle Sun Ray 3 Plus and boasts the following features:

* Low power consumption (typically around 14W)
* 4 x USB 2 ports
* Gigabit Ethernet
* SFP (all Form Pluggable) fibre optic module for use with 1000 SX, 1000 LX, or 100 FX fibre optic connectors
* 2 x DVI connectors
* 2560 x 1600 resolution for a single display or 5120 x 1600 for two displays
* Smart card reader
One big jump from the older Sun Ray 2 hardware is the gigabit Ethernet, with it's greater transfer speeds, this makes the four USB 2 ports possible.  Clients around the globe will be very happy with that.

The standard Sun Ray 2 supported a 1600 x 1200 resolution, even the Sun Ray 2FS client only supported 1920 x 1200 or 3840 x 1200 resolutions.  The Sun Ray 3 plus has a massively higher resolution with a single monitor supporting 2560 x 1600 or a dual monitor setup supporting 5120 x 1600 resolution thanks to the more powerful graphics card and the two DVI ports.

The fibre connectors are nothing new, they were present on the old Sun Ray 2FS and, of course, the standard smart card reader.

The only negative thing I have to say about this new hardware is that it takes up around 10W more than it's predecessor.

I like the fact that Oracle have released this, it shows that they are committed (at least in the immediate future) to Sun Ray and the Sun Ray software.  I'd love to see one of these things, they should really help push Sun Rays into the workplace as a very viable alternative to those lumps of metal on everyones desks!
