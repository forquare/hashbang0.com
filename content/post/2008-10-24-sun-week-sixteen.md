OK, writing this from the future, I can't remember the details of this week...

The main forcus for this week was playing with a blade chassis, and a load of blade servers.  I was playing with a mix of X64 and SPARC systems, I was amazed that you could mix the two in an enclosed unit.  I'm still unsure why you would choose a blade over a 1U unit...

I had a hard time because I needed to liaison with several owners of blades in the chassis to get them moved to other chassis.  After this was complete it was just a case of installing new blades and upgrading some firmware.  Mick (the engineer who I was doing the work for) then installed some new blades which added storage to the blade next to them.

Interesting stuff...But I think I'll try to leave them alone...
