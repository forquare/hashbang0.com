Merry Christmas to you all!

Over the last few weeks I have been updating my site [\#! - A place of geekery.][1] I've written some new tutorials for people who want to learn some common UNIX tools. All the usuals are there, cd/ls/pwd/etc but I have also detailed some other looks such as SSH/SCP/RSYNC

I haven't really been doing much else on the site, I need to continue the Java tutorial at some point...But I'm also planning on learning Pythn, bought the book and everything, just need to properly sit down and read it...

Oh yes! Just remembered, the site has moved! We are now <http://hashbang0.com>
