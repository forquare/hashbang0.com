As you can see from the image (below), I have the stats for my blog on Thursday, 1st January 1970!  I also have stats for 'yesterday' presumably meaning Wednesday, 31st December 1969!



Obviously those of you that are more observant, anyone can claim this: simply put an invalid date into the address bar!  Though interestingly, 2009-04-31 give you the date: 1st May 2009.

Just something to blog about before bed!
