Why does one start to write a blog? I know why I started mine, I wanted some representation on the web which was a bit more organised than the sites I tend to cobble together...Did I share much with you all?  [Looking back][1], no.  OK, so I've blogged about at least one thing every month...But that's just it, some months I've completely neglected this site...

I've been unable to sleep tonight, so thought I'd have a look around at friend's blogs.  It's amazing to see how many aren't updated on a regular basis, that have been left since the end of last year, or longer...There are a couple who surprise me too, a few people I would expect to update their blogs more often than I, they generally seem very interesting people, and I'm surprised that they don't update more often.

So why is it?  I know I often forget to update everyday after work, and tend to look back at the week in my weekly blogs.  I think, though, when I leave Sun, I'll probably drop back to a couple of entries a month (which will be a shame).  I think people get busy, I'll often think that the I'm doing right now is interesting, and it would be good to blog about it, but obviously I'm busy doing it, too busy to stray off to this place...

I've been looking for a Folding@Home client for OpenSolaris, the number of blogs (and forum posts) I came across from 2006 is unbelievable...And often the whole blog has been abandoned...I know I abandoned my old blogger blog, Wordpress has a much better feature list in my opinion.

I hope that I'll be able to make some time to update this place next year, in amongst the rush of uni work, a home life, and other bits and bobs I'm hoping will come together, and I hope you lot keep reading, I enjoy looking at my stats on a weekly (sometimes daily) basis and seeing that you lot have pushed for another all time high...
