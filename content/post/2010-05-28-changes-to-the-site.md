So, over the last week and last night I have been working on a script to automagically generate galleries, not that that is finished I have a brand new gallery up and running.

I have also created a breadcrumb script, in the status bar of the window you should see a new breadcrumb trail :)

The following browsers are supported 100%:

* Camino 2.0.3
* Firefox 3.5.8
* Opera 10.10
* Safari 4.0.5
* Chrome 5.0.375.55
* Lynx 2.8.7rel.1 (Yes, that's right, it works very well in a text browser too!)

Please send me any feedback on the new design :)
