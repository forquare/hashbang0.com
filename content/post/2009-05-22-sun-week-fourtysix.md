This week was another short one :D I'll just add highlights for this week.

Monday started with me being back on 9am starts. I then started troubleshooting a problem with a server in America which seemed to sort itself out.

Tuesday I fixed several SP's which had gotten themselves into a bad state and needed resetting by pulling the main power...

Wednesday I sorted out some net boot problems in the UK lab, one had previously been jump started with OpenSolaris and needed reconfiguration, another had an incorrect MAC address.

Thursday and Friday I was in Aber :D
