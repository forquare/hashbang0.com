The day started by running around the Old College looking for the workstation room, after finally finding it, I settled down to work on looking around for Java with Postgres, as this was the database we are working with...Looking around the web wasn't much help,nothing was going to be easy, especially as I'm not great with SQL.

I came home for lunch and got back to the workroom for about 3pm, I spent the afternoon looking at trying to get Postgres onto my Mac.  After using [this][1] page, I finally had it running, but had no idea how to use it :P  I gave up and came home at about 5:30.  I think I'll try and install it on my Fedora box...Actually I think there may have been a Fedora binary...
