Over the past few years I've needed to recover files from various USB sticks and SD cards using my Mac.  I've recently needed to do this again, and every time I'm asked I always forget the application I use!  So I'm created a blog post so it's easy to search for!

The application I use is [TestDisk][1].  It's a command line application and can recover files from a number of different  file systems.  It's fairly easy to use once you've read the website, and being CLI based it has the advantage that you can SSH into your friends machine and work with them over a phone/Skype/FaceTime call along with a shared screen or tmux session!
