This week was brilliant! I was on a training course: Solaris Internals.
It was great for two reasons, firstly because I missed the French lab moving over to our lab (although now I wish I had been there), and secondly, I was the only person on the course! I had an instructor all to myself, again great, but I had to make sure I paid attention as I was the only person to answer questions :P

The course focused on kernel structure, we did a lot of stuff about memory and virtual memory and tracing it through the kernel using the modular debugger (mdb). We also looked at file systems, including a small amount on ZFS, though it was old material as the course had been written before source code was released as part of the [OpenSolaris][1] project.

All in all, it was a great week, and made even better by Faye coming down on Wednesday evening and spending the week with me :D
