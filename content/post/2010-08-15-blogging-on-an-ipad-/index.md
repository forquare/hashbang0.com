I'm currently in the Cardiff Apple store playing on an iPad and I've got to say it's pretty good!

The keyboard is much better than I thought it would be, plus you get all the benefits of the auto-correcting spelling. Actually, I'm really impressed that the keyboard keeps up with normal typing speeds!

The device is nice and responsive which makes the whole experience really great, it's much better than my little first generation iPod touch.
