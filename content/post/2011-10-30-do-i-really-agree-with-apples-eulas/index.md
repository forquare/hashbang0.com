After the death of [Steve Jobs][1] Richard Stallman has [said some somewhat callous things about Jobs and Apple][2] and how they have us in "digital handcuffs". 
 
When we purchase a piece of Apple hardware or software, we must accept a EULA before we use it.  It's pretty standard in the proprietary world to put measures in place to restrict a user's use of the product. 
I am pretty confident that hundreds of users click "accept" every day without reading such a license , let alone understanding it. 
 
I have fallen in to this trap too, what "freedoms" am I signing away to Apple?  Over the next few weeks I'm going to sit down and read the EULA for Mac OS X Lion, iTunes, and iOS 5.  Am I really happy with signing these "freedoms" away?
