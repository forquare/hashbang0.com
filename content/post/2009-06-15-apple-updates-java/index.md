Well, we've been waiting, what, about two years for this now.Â  Today, Apple released Java 6 as part of it's Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 4.

The support docs (found[ here][1]) say that in this 158MB update we get:

* Java SE 6 (x64 only)
* J2SE 5.0 (PPC &amp; x64)
* J2SE 1.4.2(PPC &amp; x64)
* 64-bit Java for Intel Macs only

Upgrade today as I'm sure many developers will be wanting to update their code as part of a long awaited refactoring!
