So I have been working at sun for over a month now, and I'm still having a great time. I've decided I need to get "Networking for Dummies" to learn more about networking.

I've been really bad, I'm writing this in retrospect, and went to London the weekend after this week of work, so can't directly remember what I got up to...

I remember I was doing some swapping of disks out of a disk array, and I almost brought the whole network down :D  Well, possibly just part of it. I was to add some names to the NIS+ thingy, and thought I was doing it correctly, but actually assigned the machine name to the same IP as the default switch, so James quickly fixed this...At this point, I knew I needed to learn more about networking...
