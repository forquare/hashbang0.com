Monday starts with me coming back to work after a weeks leave. I spent much of the day picking up what I had dropped when I left, there wasn't much, but some bits needed to be done.
I potched around in the lab doing some tidying and looked at my booked machines and tidied them out too.

Tuesday I realised that it was going to be slow. There's nobody in work, the canteen is dead at lunch time! However, I did kick Ali's ass at air-hockey, winning 3-2 :D

Wednesday I was scheduled to finally upgrade enotty, however, when it came to it, Paul demanded we all had a half day, so there wasn't enough time :(
In the evening we travelled up to Cardiff to celebrate new years.

Thursday and Friday we spent in Cardiff and the surrounding area.
