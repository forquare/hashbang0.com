Last weekend it was Faye's 23rd birthday.  Having asked her previously she had joked about an iPad, so I saved and an iPad she got.  A 32GB, Wi-Fi only iPad2.

I'm impressed with the device, I've played with them in the Apple Shop, but having one at home is nice.  Faye has an old G4 iBook, this new device has somewhat elevated the iBook's duties. 
The iPad gets used for games, web browsing, email (both through Mail.app for GMail and through Safari for the uni web mail), and for watching 4OD/ITV/BBC iPlayer. 
 
This picture really captures what I think the iPad, or any other tablet, is really good for:
