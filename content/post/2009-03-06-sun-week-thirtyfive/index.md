Well, this week really wasn't very special.

I assigned some new IP's to a couple of machines.
Evaluated quite a few bugs which were all accepted to be fixed.

The most exciting things I did included talking to a very polite American engineer about booking a couple of systems and getting Suse Linux installed on them.
I also looked at the UPS system on one of our production servers. It was complaining about the battery which had failed a test. I've changed the battery and I need to make sure it's still OK.

That's it really, a very uninteresting week!
