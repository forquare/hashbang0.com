Since my last post I eventually got around to trying to install Debian and Fedora onto my spare box...But it would appear that neither would run on it...I spent today jiggling my main box around to fit not only Windows and Solaris, but also Debian and Fedora...Alas, Debian still won't run (doesn't install GRUB so can't boot to it). Fedora would go, but Solaris was stubborn. Just about to reinstall Solaris now to see if I can rectify the problem...Ahhh, the wonders of technology...
