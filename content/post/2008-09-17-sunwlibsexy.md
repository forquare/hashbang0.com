I'm just updating packages on my OpenSolaris installation, and I glanced at the screen only to find a package called "SUNWlibsexy" sitting bang in the middle of the update screen. After a quick Google, I found this:
> Name: SUNWlibsexy
License: Other
Group: System/Libraries
Version: 0.1.11
Summary: libsexy is a collection of GTK+ widgets that extend the functionality of such standard widget.
From here: [clicky][1]

Just one more thing in computer science which is...Interesting...
