So this week I've been on my [15k][1]/[25k][2] maintenance course. It's was very boring. It was basically the serengeti training all over again.

It's basically a big box with up to 18 systems boards in. Each system board has up to 4 CPU's and 32 sticks of RAM. These system boards can be joined together to create 'domains', these domains can run instances of Solaris, so you effectively get one system spread over several boards...You can even add and remove system boards while a domain is running!

It's a remarkable piece of kit...But it was pretty boring to learn...
