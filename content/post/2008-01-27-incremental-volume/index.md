A good friend of mine, Aled Hughes, spoke to me today on MSN and was talking to me about a feature he found on Leopard. If you press **shift**+**option**+**volume** (option being 'alt'), then you can increment/decrement the volume by a quarter of a volume block:

Another of those little features Apple like to hide :D
