Up at 8 am this morning and on the bus by 8:50. Got to an empty computer room to find only one of my team members there. I sat in wait until about 9:30, waiting for team members to appear, or even just other groups...

At 9:30, I moved to the Sun Lounge when a couple of team mates came in. I spent this morning looking at files, formatting them, making sure they were commented right etc. Emails were flying around with new version, new version1, newer version and similar, useful filenames...
We finally got some classes into our Approved code folder:
```
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 2381 Feb 1 11:51 Channel.java
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 8448 Feb 1 11:51 ClientCommunicator.java
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 5814 Feb 1 11:51 GSearch.java
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 530 Feb 1 11:51 Main.java
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 2636 Feb 1 11:51 Program.java
-rwxrwx--- 1 bil6 csgp08 1077 Feb 1 11:51 View.java
```

At noon I was feeling hungry and decided to treat myself to a Meal Deal in the uni, a packet of crisps and a BLT later, I was back on the case of looking for code, trying to get people to complete classes.

This afternoon has been hectic, people running round, we've converted our Application to an Applet, and the UI won't display some tables properly, but things seem to be making slow progress...A little too slow.

As I write this now, it's about an hour until hand in. We should start testing and more tidying up soon....

* 15:45 - All .java files get handed to me to start commenting and formatting.
* 16:20 - Source files are finished and uploaded into filestore.
* 16:28 - Burning of the hand-in CD begins
* 16:30 - CD is handed to Rhys.

It was close, but it got handed in :D I think it all pretty much worked, everything but the search feature...So that was good. A weight off all our shoulders, can now enjoy my Birthday tomorrow :D
