Summarising events this week:

Monday I got back into work and spent some more time on the KVM that wasn't playing ball, it still isn't now :(

Tuesday I had an 880 in the 02 lab which needed a new board, so that was replaced in the afternoon.

Wednesday I hooked a T1000 and an x4240 together.

Thursday I was looking at the 25k downstairs, trying to get a domain to work.

Friday I had a play with a machine and some ZFS stuff, I'm trying to figure out how I can upgrade my mirror to have two 1TB hard drives in as apposed to the two 500GB drives I have at the moment (I'm down to 100GB space left!)  I also looked at adding some storage to a machine in the lab.
