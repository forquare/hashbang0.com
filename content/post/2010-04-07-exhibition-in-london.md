Faye and some others from the Aberystwyth university are putting on an exhibition in London between 2nd April and 16th April.  The exhibition is taking place in the Proud Central Gallery (32 John Adam Street - WC2N 6BP), just off the Strand and literally a minutes walk from Charing Cross.

The exhibition is the display of 19 artists work, all in the medium of photography.  It's well worth a visit, especially as it's FREE to get in!  Support the artists by buying a catalogue (a bargain at £4) and if you see a piece of work you like, please buy it!
