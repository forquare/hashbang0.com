Well, it looks like [Oracle has pulled OpenSolaris][1].  Hopefully the [Illumos project][2] will continue and make some sort of replacement for the loss.

Over the past week or so I've been thinking about jumping to [FreeBSD][3], the project has ZFS which is my main requirement for a home file server.  I'll wait a little longer to see what Illumos is going to do, then see if the jump should be done.
