Yesterday while surfing the web, a pop-up notified me that the Camino 2.0 RC was available to download and install!
Heading over to [Camino's web site][1], I found the team thanking all the beta testers. 
<!--more--> 
Looking at the [preview page][2], it still looks like they are plugging the beta.  However, I guess if you download the beta it will ask you to update to the latest version. 
 
All in all I can't see much difference to the fourth beta, though no doubt it's more stable, etc etc etc... 
 
The fourth beta came out 18th September this year, a month and a half later and we get the RC.  Hopefully Camino 2.0 will officially be along shortly.
