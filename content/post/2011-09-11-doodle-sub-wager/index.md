A couple of friends have made some apps for the iPhone/iPod Touch, so I thought I'd quickly plug them :P 
 
![alt text](wager.png "Wager")

First up is [Wager by Tom Diggle][2].  This app is handy for calculating the return and profit of many betting types. 
 
It sports a succinct UI which is both fast and effective and allows for multiple bets to be stored for later reference. 
 
Find it on the [App Store for just 69p][3]!

Next we have [Doodle Sub by Oliver Foggin][5].  A simple game, yet so frustrating and highly addictive! 
 
Dive your sub to the depths of the ocean, is there ever an end!?  If there is, I've not found it yet! 
 
Once again, this can be found on the [App Store for just 69p!][6]
