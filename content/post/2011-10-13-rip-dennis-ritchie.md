Co-writer of the [C language][1] and co-creator of the [UNIX operating system][2] [Dennis Ritchie][3] sadly passed away last Saturday.  It seems his death was somewhat overlooked due to the [passing of Steve Jobs][4]. 
 
Thanks to Ritchie's contributions to computing, we have the C language and its derivatives (including Java, C++, Objective-C, JavaScript, [and more][5]), and UNIX with its derivatives (including Mac OS X, BSD, Solaris, Linux).
