OK, exams finished on Thursday...I let myself recoup on Friday and today I decided have a play with my spare tower...Up until recently I have had [OpenSuse][1] 10.2 on there running GNOME (the CPU is an old AMD Athlon and it has an ancient GPU and goodness knows how much RAM).

Anyway, I decided to look around and decided on reinstalling the tower with [Fedora][2] 8 and [Debian][3] 4. [Fedora][4] asked for a single DVD to install the OS, which was great, I've got two DVDs left in my supply and about five CD's. [Fedora][5] is downloading now though uTorrent on Windows (slowly through my internet connection :-( ).
I went to the [Debian][6] site and looked at downloaded the DVD, surely it's only a DVD? Fedora was, [Suse][7] was, I'm sure [Ubuntu][8] is too...But nope, [Debian][9] is three DVDs big! So I looked around the site and found just what I wanted: a network install. All I needed was 1.44MB worth of files that would go and connect to the [Debian][10] servers and install the OS for me. I hunted high and low in my room and found that I have no floppy disks...Then, looking in the tower, I realised that I had taken out my floppy drive from the tower...Brilliant stuff eh!?
So, instead I had to download a disk image (all of 44MB I think) and shove it in the machine, it would link to the other images online and install the OS from there! "Great!" I thought, "Simple, may take a while, but only one CD!", thinking this after looking at the nine or ten CD images [Debian][11] asked for...I downloaded this small image, burnt it to a CD and whacked it in the machine, booted it up and tapped 'enter' when asked to install. I came to a menu, looking down I asked it to detect my network configuration, but it couldn't work my network card!!! Grrrr, I'm now downloading the three DVD images via BitTorrent :-( I'm not a happy bunny...

Off out for a grump with some friends, and they will be hearing about this you can be sure!
