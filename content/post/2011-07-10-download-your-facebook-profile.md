Now I have a Google+ account (more on that later) I want to start moving my life from Facebook to the new shiny thing. Â Thankfully, Facebook make it somewhat easier than one would expect. 
 
If you navigate to Account &gt; Account Settings then click on the "learn more" link next to "Download your information", you'll be able to request for Facebook to zip up all your data (well, most of it) and make it available for you as a download (I had to wait ~5 hours for my 66mb of data to be made available). 
 
I can then simply upload all of this into Google+ at my convenience!
