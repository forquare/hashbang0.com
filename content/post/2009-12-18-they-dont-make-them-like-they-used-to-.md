Faye has got a new phone, some up-to-date Nokia to replace her old 6200.  Her 6230 still works apart, just the battery doesn't hold a charge very well.
This new phone cost about the same price as the six year old phone, has less useful features, doesn't keep the same charge as the 6200 did when new and broke after six months of use...After getting it back from the O2 shop, they are telling us that it broke because of rust...

The old 6200 has been dropped in photo chemicals, dropped many a time and has been run over by the Faye's KA.  This new one seems to have broken because it has a small amount of photo chemicals dripped over it...

Why oh why isn't technology today more robust?  Or at least as robust as it used to be...Yes, phone manufacturers want you to upgrade your phone every now and again, but every six months!?
