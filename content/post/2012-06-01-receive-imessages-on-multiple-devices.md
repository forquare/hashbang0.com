If you have an iPhone and an iPad or a Mac running Messages.app you may have noticed that messages don't seem to appear across devices, or that you have multiple conversations for someone. 
 
Think of email, you have one email address (e.g. anon@hashbang0.com) and if someone emails that address, you can receive the email on multiple devices (e.g. iPhone, iPad, and Mac) so long as you've registered that email address with the device. 
iMessages are the same.  You can add email addresses to iMessages and when someone sends an iMessage to that email address, you'll see it on every device it's registered to. 
 
Setting this up is really easy: 

1. Open Settings
2. Tap Messages
3. Scroll down and tap Receive At
4. Tap Add Another Email
5. Type new email address
6. Verify the email address
7. Off you go! 
Once you have verified the address you can send and receive iMessages form and to the email address and the phone number!
