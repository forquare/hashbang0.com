A fellow Mac User has pointed me to look at TextEdit.app with Coverflow. Blown up it looks like this:[![][1]][2]

_**"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.**_

_**The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo.**_

_**You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.**__** Because they change things.**__**"**_ - <http://www.virtualteacher.com.au/crazyone.html>

The poem seems to be created by Apple for use as an advert: [Clicky for YouTube][3] - Thanks to CC on the MacUser forums.

As for John Appleseed, there is a Wiki on him [here][4], I've linked you down to the place where he concerns Apple Inc.

I wonder who Kate might be...
