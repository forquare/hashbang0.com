A while ago I blogged about [Facebook having some problems][1].  Well it appears they may have done something rather odd.

After seeing a Facebook post by [Jonathan Roscoe][2], I have decided that Facebook must be tagging posts as adverts...By uninstalling my default AdBlock plug-in in Chrome and instead using [AdBlock Plus][3] which allows for more customisation, I was able to put Facebook on my whitelist.

Below is a video (sans sound) which walks through the steps of installing AdBlock Plus and customising it using Google Chrome 9 on OS X, but this should work on Windows and Linux too.  Other browsers should have similar plug-ins or customisations available.

UPDATE:
This doesn't seem to cure all problems, though it does solve some.
